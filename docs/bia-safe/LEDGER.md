#### The Accounting Equation
- The amount of the resources supplied by the owners is called **capital**
- The actual resources that are in the business are called **assets**
`assets = capital`
- **Liabilities** represent the amounts owing to people other than the owners(s) in relation to supply of the assets
` assets = capital + liabilities`

#### Double-entry Principle
- Every business transaction has a twofold aspect
- Both sides must be recorded
- The double-entry system has an account for every asset, every liability and capital
